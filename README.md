Prototyping and eventually (hopefully) building a plugin for de-clipping audio files that is open source and easy to use

Plan:
- prototyping in Matlab/Octave 
  (note: keep code compatible with Octave, try to avoid using special Matlab toolboxes, so that porting will be easier
   and anybody can collaborate)

( -porting in Python for larger possible user/collaborator base? but still Octave is simple, lightweight and open-source, so...) )

- once the algorithm is established, build a vst plugin for use in DAWs



many comments in the code are still in italian, sorry
